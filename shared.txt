Fish "mystery merge" test: change by me, causing my "working" repo
to become out of sync with the remote repo, as a result of me having
committed this change to my local repo before doing a pull from the
remote repo. (But then too, the pull I could have done immediately
before my commit COULD have said "Up to date" as a result of the
other person doing their push shortly AFTER I did my trial pull).
